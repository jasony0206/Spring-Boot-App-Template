# Spring Boot Application Template
This is a tutorial-like template of a Spring Boot Java web application. Various endpoints are available, with each utilizing a distinct feature that Spring Boot provides out of the box. In addition, Thymeleaf template engine is integrated to help visualize endpoints while maintaining the MVC architecture. 

### To run unit tests:
`mvn clean test`

### To run integration tests:
`mvn clean install`

`mvn spring-boot:run` and you can access the application at localhost:8080
